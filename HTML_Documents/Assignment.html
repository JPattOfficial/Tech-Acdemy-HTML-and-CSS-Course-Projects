			Siberian Husky, breed of working dog raised in Siberia by the Chukchi people, who valued it as a sled dog and companion. It was brought to Alaska in 1909 for sled dog races and soon became established as a consistent winner. In 1925 the breed gained widespread fame by saving Nome, Alaska, during a diphtheria epidemic; teams of Siberian Huskies battled blizzard conditions to relay life-saving serum over 674 miles (1,085 km) to the icebound city.
